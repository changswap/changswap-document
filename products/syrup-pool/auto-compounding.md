# Auto CHANG Brewery Pool

## Stake CHANG, earn CHANG!

You've now got two delicious flavors of CHANG-CHANG Brewery Pool to choose from: Auto-compounding, and Manual. Read on to learn more!

![Auto CHANG & Manual CHANG Pools](../../.gitbook/assets/auto-and-manual-pools.png)

### What’s the difference between the “Auto CHANG Pool” and the “Manual CHANG Pool”? <a href="#docs-internal-guid-c4c16237-7fff-3c33-3a56-18ccd8853f86" id="docs-internal-guid-c4c16237-7fff-3c33-3a56-18ccd8853f86"></a>

**With both pools, you can simply stake your CHANG tokens to earn more CHANG tokens.**&#x20;

But there are some differences:

**Manual CHANG**

* You need to harvest or compound (reinvest) your CHANG by yourself. That means returning to the site, tapping buttons, and using a bit of KUB for transaction fees.
* Interest is displayed as APR, which doesn’t include compounding.
* Deposits [SYRUP Token](brewery-pool-faq.md#whats-brewery-token) to your wallet upon staking

**Auto CHANG**

* Stake your CHANG and forget about it! The CHANG you stake in this Brewery Pool will be automatically compounded (reinvested) for you, minus a small fee.
* The “automatic” compounding function is triggered by other users who get a small bounty for triggering it.
* Interest is displayed as APY, which includes compounding.
* A small performance fee is subtracted from your earnings each time the pool is automatically compounded. See below.
* An unstaking fee applies when you unstake within 3 days of manually staking. See below.
* Does not deposit SYRUP to your wallet upon staking

### What are the fees for the Auto CHANG Brewery Pool?

**Deposit fee**

* **None**

**Unstaking fee**&#x20;

* **0.1%  if you unstake (withdraw) within 72 hours.**
* Only applies within 3 days of manually staking.
* After 3 days, you can unstake with **no fee**.
* The 3-day timer resets every time you manually stake more CHANG in the pool.
* This fee only applies to manual unstaking: it does not apply to automatic compounding.

**Performance fee**

* **2%, subtracted automatically from each yield harvest**.
* For example, if the harvest was 1 CHANG, then 0.02 CHANG would be subtracted as the performance fee.

{% hint style="info" %}
The CHANG collected via the unstaking fee and performance fee is **burned every week** as part of the regular CHANG token burns.&#x20;

This is a good thing for CHANG holders because it reduces the overall amount of CHANG tokens in existence, which helps reduce inflation.

### What's the best way to use the Auto CHANG Brewery Pool? <a href="#docs-internal-guid-3b1f91a6-7fff-fc76-976a-3a06bada2520" id="docs-internal-guid-3b1f91a6-7fff-fc76-976a-3a06bada2520"></a>

Simple: stake your CHANG, but only withdraw after 72 hours (if you need to). This way you only pay the performance fee, and not the unstaking fee.

### What’s the Auto CHANG bounty?

**Auto CHANG Bounty: 0.05% of all Auto CHANG pool users’ pending yield**

This bounty is given as a reward for providing a service to other users.

Whenever you successfully claim the bounty, you’re also helping out by activating the Auto CHANG Pool’s compounding function for everyone.

Make sure the amount of CHANG you receive will be greater than the KUB fees you’ll spend to submit the blockchain transaction!
