# How to Stake in Brewery Pools with BkcScan

![](../../.gitbook/assets/docs-masthead-2-%20%282%29.png)

Some users may want to take advantage of ChangSwap's Brewery Pools using BkcScan instead of the website UI.

You'll be interacting with one of two contracts, depending on if you want to use the Auto CHANG Brewery Pool, or one of the other available Brewery Pools. This guide will help you through interacting with the contracts and get you stacking those sweet, breweryy rewards.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Please understand that using BkcScan to interact with contracts is not recommended for beginners. If you're not feeling confident, we suggest using the [How to Stake in Brewery Pools guide](https://docs.changswap.com/products/brewery-pool/brewery-pool-guide) instead.
