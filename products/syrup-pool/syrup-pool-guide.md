# How to Stake in Brewery Pools

![](../../.gitbook/assets/docs-masthead-15-.png)

Staking in [Brewery Pools](https://docs.changswap.com/products/brewery-pool) lets you earn CHANG or other tokens while you sleep!

It's simpler than farming with ChangSwap's Yield Farms, because unlike the Farms, you only need to stake **one token** to start earning: usually CHANG.

## **Getting started with Brewery Pool staking**

1\. Go to the Pools page [here](https://changswap.com/pools).

2\. Connect to your Bitkub Chain-compatible wallet by clicking the **Connect** button (top right-hand side).

3\. Click **Unlock Wallet**.

4\. Choose which Brewery Pool you want to stake in.

**Auto CHANG** automatically compounds your rewards: any CHANG you earn will be harvested and re-invested in the same pool for you.

**Manual CHANG** doesn’t automatically compound like Auto CHANG. You’ll need to harvest and compound your earnings manually.

Other Brewery Pools let you stake your CHANG to earn dozens of other cool tokens. Make sure you check them out.\\

5\. Once you choose a pool, click the **Enable** button. Your wallet will ask you to confirm the action.

6\. The Enable button should now be replaced with **Stake**. Click the button to bring up the staking menu.

9\. The Confirm button will change to \*\*"\*\*Confirming", then once the transaction is successful, you’ll see your staked amount change and the button will change again.

10\. You should now be able to see details on your Brewery Pool. Auto CHANG will show a countdown until the unstaking fee ends. The other pools will show a **Collect** button to claim your staking rewards into your wallet.

### **Adding and removing CHANG from a pool** \*\*\*\*

You can easily add more CHANG to a Brewery Pool, or move some CHANG to a more profitable pool. Here’s how you can move your staked CHANG.

1\. Click the **-** to take some CHANG out of a pool, or the **+** to add more to the pool.

Please note that unstaking from the Auto CHANG pool has a fee of 0.1% if you unstake within 72 hours.

2\. A window will open. If you clicked the **+**, choose the amount you would like to add to the pool. If you clicked the **-**, choose the amount to take out of the pool.

4\. After a little wait, you'll be able to see your new amount of staked tokens.
