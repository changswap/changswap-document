# Liquidity Pools

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/docs-masthead-4- (1).png>)

When you add your token to a Liquidity Pool you will receive Liquidity Provider (LP) tokens and share in the fees.

## LP Tokens

As an example, if you deposited **CHANG** and **KUB** into a Liquidity Pool, you'd receive **CHANG-KUB LP** tokens.

The number of LP tokens you receive represents your portion of the CHANG-KUB Liquidity Pool.&#x20;

You can also redeem your funds at any time by removing your liquidity.

## Liquidity Providers earn trading fees

Providing liquidity gives you a reward in the form of trading fees when people use your liquidity pool.&#x20;

Whenever someone trades on ChangSwap, the trader pays a 0.25% fee, **of which 0.17%** is added to the Liquidity Pool of the swap pair they traded on.

For example:

* There are 10 LP tokens representing 10 CHANG and 10 KUB tokens.
* 1 LP token = 1 CHANG + 1 KUB
* Someone trades 10 CHANG for 10 KUB.
* Someone else trades 10 KUB for 10 CHANG.
* The CHANG/KUB liquidity pool now has 10.017 CHANG and 10.017 KUB.
* Each LP token is now worth 1.00017 CHANG + 1.00017 KUB.

To make being a liquidity provider even more worth your while, you can also put your LP tokens to work whipping up some fresh yield on the [CHANG Farms](https://changswap.com/farms), while still earning your 0.17% trading fee reward.

## Impermanent Loss

Providing liquidity is not without risk, as you may be exposed to impermanent loss.
