## How can I stake CHANG?

You can stake your CHANG in ChangSwap Brewery Pools. Visit the [Brewery Pools page](https://changswap.com/pools).

Read our [How to Stake in Brewery Pools guide](https://docs.changswap.com/products/brewery-pool/brewery-pool-guide) if you'd like a hand getting started with staking.

## What is the difference between staking and farming?

Staking in Brewery Pools and farming with Yield Farming are both ways to earn more CHANG by supporting ChangSwap.

Staking only needs some CHANG to be added to a Brewery Pool to earn CHANG or other tokens.\
[Learn more about Brewery Pool staking.](https://docs.changswap.com/products/brewery-pool)

Farming is more complicated and needs LP Tokens to earn CHANG.\
[Learn more about Yield Farming.](https://docs.changswap.com/products/yield-farming)

## How do I farm?

We have a [Yield Farming guide](https://docs.changswap.com/products/yield-farming/how-to-use-farms) if you're interested in learning how to farm.

## Where can I view the ChangSwap roadmap?

You can [view our to-do list here, but don't call it a roadmap](https://docs.changswap.com/roadmap).

## How do I connect my wallet to Bitkub Chain and ChangSwap?

We have a [Connect Your Wallet to ChangSwap guide](https://docs.changswap.com/get-started/connection-guide) covering this in detail.

## What's the best wallet for ChangSwap?

It depends on your needs. We have an [in-depth guide to selecting and creating a wallet](https://docs.changswap.com/get-started/wallet-guide) that's right for you.

## Why is my transaction failing?

You can check the status of a transaction on [https://bkcscan.com/](https://bkcscan.com).

Our [Troubleshooting Errors guide](https://docs.changswap.com/help/troubleshooting) may have a solution for your problem if you're having issues.

You can also see our [Fixing Stuck Pending Transactions guide](https://docs.changswap.com/help/unsticking-a-transaction-stuck-as-pending-with-metamask) if you have a stuck transaction.

## When will you open more pools?

New Pools are added to ChangSwap frequently. There will always be an announcement before the launch of new pools.

Join the [announcements Telegram group](https://t.me/ChangSwapAnn) to learn about new Pools as early as possible.

## Did Farm APR calculation change?

Previously, rewards earned by LP Token-holders generated from trading fees were not included in Farm APR calculations. APR calculations now include these rewards, and better reflect the expected APR for Farm pairs.

## How do I get airdrops?

Whenever there is an official airdrop on ChangSwap it will be announced along with the requirements.

Please remember anyone can airdrop tokens to ChangSwap users since every transaction is public on BkcScan. Be sure to do your own research when it comes to non-official airdrops. To protect your funds, we recommend you don't use a smart contract you don't understand from a source you don't trust.

## How can I report a bug?

Learn about our [bug bounty and potential bounty payouts](https://docs.changswap.com/code/bug-bounty).

## Where can I view smart contracts?

Learn how to find smart contracts on our [Finding Contracts page](https://docs.changswap.com/code/smart-contracts).

## Why does it say I have no KUB balance?

If you've already [transferred KUB into your Bitkub Chain-enabled wallet](https://docs.changswap.com/get-started/kep20-guide) but still have this error, you're most likely not [connected to Bitkub Chain](https://docs.changswap.com/get-started/connection-guide) within your wallet. Check your wallet's selected network and make sure you have Bitkub Chain (BKC) selected.

## What are the treasury funds used for?

The treasury funds are used to cover the expenses involved in running ChangSwap. These expenses include salaries, audits, prizes, hosting, upkeep, bounties, etc.

## Is ChangSwap protected from flashloan attacks?

ChangSwap's vault has anti-flashloan protection. ChangSwap’s CHANG token isn’t vulnerable to flash loan attacks. Unlike vulnerable tokens, CHANG token minting is predefined, and can’t be adjusted in a single transaction. Ownership cannot be transferred outside of MasterChef contract.

ChangSwap’s other smart contracts, like IFO and AutoPool, are protected as well; they prevent other contracts from interacting with them, reducing the scope of vector attacks.



## What is BREWERY?

BREWERY was a part of the staking process earlier in ChangSwap's life. BREWERY was discontinued when a security issue was discovered and is no longer a part of ChangSwap.
