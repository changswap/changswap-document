{% hint style="success" %}
**ChangSwap helps you make the most out of your crypto in three ways:**

**Trade, Earn, and Win.**
{% endhint %}

## ‚ÜîÔ∏è Trade

> Instantly swap crypto tokens: no registration or account needed.

### The people's choice

ChangSwap is the leading decentralized exchange on Bitkub Chain, with the highest trading volumes in the market (sources: [1](https://www.coingecko.com/en/exchanges/decentralized) [2](https://coinmarketcap.com/rankings/exchanges/dex/)).

### Low fees

Why pay more? ChangSwap runs on Bitkub Chain, a blockchain with much lower transaction costs than Ethereum or Bitcoin.\
Trading fees are lower than other top decentralized exchanges too, so that's a double win for you!

### Decentralized

Trade directly from your wallet app.\
Unlike centralized exchanges like Binance or Coinbase, ChangSwap doesn‚Äôt hold your funds when you trade: **you have 100% ownership of your own crypto**.

## üí∏ Earn

> Earn CHANG and other tokens for free with super high interest rates.

### Earn tokens with Brewery Pools

Stake CHANG, earn free tokens. It‚Äôs really that easy.\
CHANG holders right now are earning tens of millions of USD worth of free tokens each week from major projects. New projects join the party frequently, so you can earn more, for even longer.

### Earn CHANG with Yield Farms

Stake LP tokens, earn CHANG. You take on a little more exposure to market fluctuations than with the Brewery Pools, but can earn higher APR to offset the risk.

### Earn Trading Fees

No farm? No problem. Even if your trading pair isn‚Äôt supported on the Farms page, you can still earn trading fees when you stake your tokens in Liquidity Pools (LPs).

## üé≤ Win

> ChangSwap makes making money fun.

### Lottery

**Millions of dollars** regularly go up for grabs on the ChangSwap Lottery.\
Join as many as **11,000 daily players** for your chance to win big!

### NFT Collectibles

Win collectible NFTs for participating in trading competitions and more fun & games.

### Prediction

Win KUB if you can predict whether the KUB price will rise or fall.\
New rounds every 5 minutes!
