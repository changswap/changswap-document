## The basics

CHANG is the delicious token that powers the ChangSwap ecosystem.

Earn CHANG from Farms and Brewery Pools, win it in the lottery, or [buy it on the exchange](../../products/changswap-exchange/), then explore its use cases:

* Stake it in [Brewery Pools](../../products/brewery-pool/) to earn free tokens
* Use it in [Yield Farms](https://docs.changswap.com/products/yield-farming) to earn more CHANG
* Buy Lottery tickets in the [ChangSwap Lottery](../../products/lottery/)
* Participate in [IFO Token Sales](../../products/ifo-initial-farm-offering/)
* Create your [Chang Profile](../../products/nft-profile-system/) and mint NFTs
* [Vote on proposals](../../products/voting/) relating to the ChangSwap ecosystem

But that's not all -- there's much more on the horizon for CHANG!
