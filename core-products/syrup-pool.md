# SYRUP Pool

**Imagine:**

1. You STAKE your CHANG to get SYRUP
2. Now you are earning a portion of 25% of each block reward
3. Now you stake that SYRUP and start earning tokens from brand new BKC projects

This is galaxy mega brain CHANG compounding.

Your CHANG is now pulling in **multiple** income streams.

Sounds‚Ä¶ ‚Äúsweet‚Äù, right? üòè

**SYRUP Pool: where sweet, new tokens meet the ChangSwap community!**

Brewery Pool allows Bitkub Chain projects to bootstrap adoption by distributing a portion of their tokens to SYRUP token holders.

Brewery Pool will be split into two sections: Core and Community.

* Core will be initially selected by the ChangSwap team.
* Community will be projects that pass a community vote on the governance portal.

Note that any project will be able to distribute tokens via Brewery Pool but only projects that win a vote would be listed on the swap interface as a default option \(in order to discourage scams\).

**Why would projects want to participate?**

Since ChangSwap has had the [fairest launch ever](https://medium.com/@changswap/the-fairest-launch-ever-5b246644ba2a), SYRUP Pool projects will allow projects to receive market attention by issuing tokens to the largest \(and most active\) BKC community.

Projects will also receive an immediate default listing on the ChangSwap interface, obtaining priority promotion on the exchange \(by ranking temporarily first in selecting tokens on the website\).

**Extending the utility of SYRUP tokens**

Governance, collecting fees, stacking CHANG block rewards and the \(upcoming\) Golden Brewery lottery are some of the SYRUP token‚Äôs core utility functions‚Ä¶ for now.

With SYRUP Pool, a new function has been offered for SYRUP holders in ChangSwap: adding the toppings to $SYRUP and the $CHANG.
