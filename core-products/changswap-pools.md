# Pools

\*\*\*\*[**ChangSwap pools** ](https://changswap.com/#/pool)allow you to provide liquidity by adding your tokens to liquidity pools or “LPs”.

When you add your token to a liquidity pool \(LP\), you will receive FLIP tokens \(ChangSwap’s version of liquidity provider tokens\).

As an example, if you deposited $CHANG and $KUB into a liquidity pool, you would receive CHANG-KUB FLIP tokens.

The number of FLIP tokens you receive represents your portion of the CHANG-KUB liquidity pool. You can also redeem your funds at any time by removing your liquidity.

Providing liquidity is not without risk, as you may be exposed to impermanent loss.  
[“Simply put, impermanent loss is the difference between holding tokens in an AMM and holding them in your wallet.” - Nate Hindman](https://blog.bancor.network/beginners-guide-to-getting-rekt-by-impermanent-loss-7c9510cb2f22)

It’s not all bad for liquidity providers as you will also be given a reward in the form of trading fees. Whenever someone trades ChangSwap, the trader pays a 0.2% fee, of which 0.17% is added to the liquidity pool of the swap pair they traded on.

For example:

* There are 10 FLIP tokens representing 10 CHANG and 10 KUB tokens.
* 1 FLIP token = 1 CHANG + 1 KUB
* Someone trades 10 CHANG for 10 KUB.
* Someone else trades 10 KUB for 10 CHANG.
* The CHANG/KUB liquidity pool now has 10.017 CHANG and 10.017 KUB.
* Each FLIP token is now worth 1.00017 CHANG + 1.00017 KUB.

To make being a liquidity provider even more worth your while, you can also put your FLIP tokens to work whipping up some fresh yield on the [CHANG farms \(here\)](https://changswap.com/), while still earning your 0.17% trading fee reward.
