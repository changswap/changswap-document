# Get KEP20 Tokens

![](<../.gitbook/assets/docs-masthead-10- (1).png>)

The native tokens of Bitkub Chain (BKC) are **KEP20**.

To do most things on BKC, you will need to pay gas, which comes in the form of KEP20 KUB.

You will also need the KEP20 version of any token you want to trade, stake etc. on BKC.

You can go a few ways about converting your tokens to KEP20, but here are the ones we recommend:
